In this article I would like to describe how did I bootstrapped this page.

<!--more-->
Firstly, I had to install Ubuntu virtual machine, because Linux is being better supported by Jekyll.
Installing Ubuntu with quest additions, tools and shared folder took quite a bit of time.
Whole setup looks like this:

- Windows as host system with Intelij IDE and shared folder with blog repo
- Ubuntu guest on VirtualBox with Jekyll and other necessary tools

As mentioned before, this blog uses white-paper template cloned
from this [repository](https://github.com/vinitkumar/white-paper).
