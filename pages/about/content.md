## Something about me ðŸ™‚

My name is PrzemysÅ‚aw Åšwiderski.
The shortened form is Przemek [ðŸ”Š](/pages/about/Przemek.mp3).
I am from Poland and this is my blog ðŸ‘‹.

I am writing some codes for a living since about 2016,
but I've been sitting in front of computers since I was 7 years old ðŸ˜….

Generally I am trying to keep things simple and as
somebody smart once said:

> The Best Code is No Code At All ðŸ™‚

**BUT** always keeping in mind that:

> "No code" is someone else's code ðŸ˜…

In my free time I like to work out, play the guitar, cook, travel and track rockets.

This is my GitHub account
