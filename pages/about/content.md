## Something about me

My name is PrzemysÅ‚aw Åšwiderski.
The shortened form is Przemek [ðŸ”Š](Przemek.mp3).
I am from Poland and this is my blog ðŸ‘‹.

I have been writing some codes for a living since about 2016.

My main tools to do the job are Java/Kotlin, but I also have experience with TypeScript and Python.

Generally, I am trying to keep things simple, and as somebody once said:

> The Best Code is No Code At All

**but** always keeping in mind that:

> "No code" is someone else's code

In my free time, I like to work out, play the guitar, cook, travel, or track the rockets ðŸ™‚.
