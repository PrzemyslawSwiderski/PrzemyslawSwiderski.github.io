## Something about me

My name is PrzemysÅ‚aw Åšwiderski.
You can call me Przemek [ðŸ”Š](Przemek.mp3), and this is my blog! ðŸ‘‹.

I've been writing code professionally since around 2016, but for fun, much longer.

My primary tools of choice are Java and Kotlin, though I also have experience with TypeScript and Python.

I strive to keep things simple. As someone once said:

> The best code is no code at all.

**However**, I always keep in mind that:

> "No code" is just someone else's code.

In my free time, I enjoy working out, playing the guitar, cooking, traveling, and tracking rocket launches ðŸ™‚.
