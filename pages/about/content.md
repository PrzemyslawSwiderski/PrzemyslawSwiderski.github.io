## Something about me

My name is Przemysław Świderski.
You can call me Przemek [🔊](Przemek.mp3), and this is my blog! 👋.

I've been writing code professionally since around 2016, but for fun, much longer.

My primary tools of choice are Java and Kotlin, though I also have experience with TypeScript and Python.

I strive to keep things simple. As someone once said:

> The best code is no code at all.

In my free time, I enjoy working out, flying drones, playing the guitar, dancing, cooking, traveling or tracking rocket
launches 🙂.
