# Introduction

Reasons for the creation of my very own IP camera:

* open source, so the software can be shared with others
* prevent connection to shady remote servers
* cheaper price
* browser based Web UI
* possibility to mount the camera as VTX for drone 

# Hardware

ESP32-P4 Development Board with speaker and OV5647 camera.
