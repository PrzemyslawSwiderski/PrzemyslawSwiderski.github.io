Not only did they safely recover the first stage, but they also managed to make
the Starship even more resilient compared to the previous flight.

Even more impressive was that with the help of Starlink, they were able to capture
live images of Starship breaking through the atmosphere:

This is a major step in making space more affordable.

To put things into perspective, Starship is able to send 100 tons to space in a single launch,
which is like sending 5 buses or 800 fridges.

There are also plans to make it even more powerful with
the [Block 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Block_3) version.

The future is looking bright for space exploration ðŸ˜Š.
