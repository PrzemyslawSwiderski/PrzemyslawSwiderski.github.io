In this post, I'll share my experience
and highlights from the summit.</p><hr /><h1>In between sessions <a id="in-between-sessions" href="/posts/aws-summit-2025#in-between-sessions" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h1><h2>Venue <a id="venue" href="/posts/aws-summit-2025#venue" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Compared to the event in Warsaw a year ago, I believe the venue and organization were significantly better.
The main exhibition hall was very spacious, with no &quot;traffic&quot; congestion. In contrast, at the Warsaw event,
the sponsor stands were spread across different floors, which sometimes led to crowded conditions.</p><p>The rooms where the sessions were held were also much more spacious.
This was particularly true for the Keynote Hall and Auditorium,
where everyone had a comfortable seat, and the speakers experienced
no technical issues (at least none that I noticed ðŸ˜Š).</p><h2>Exhibitions and Games <a id="exhibitions-and-games" href="/posts/aws-summit-2025#exhibitions-and-games" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>During the Summit, various AWS teams showcased engaging demos and exhibitions.</p><h3>Free Kick Challenge <a id="free-kick-challenge" href="/posts/aws-summit-2025#free-kick-challenge" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p><img src="/pages/posts/aws-summit-2025/footballChallenge.gif" alt="Free Kick Challenge" class="markdown-img" /></p><p>The challenge was to score a goal with the fastest dribbling time and shot speed possible.</p><p>I tried my hand at it but would rather not share the details ðŸ˜….
Essentially, I performed much worse than the person in the GIF.
Out of three shots, one hit the post, and the others veered far from the goal ðŸ˜Š.</p><p>It was an exhilarating and well-organized game.
I even saw that someone on the leaderboard kicked the ball at a speed exceeding 90 km/h.</p><h3>Dream City <a id="dream-city" href="/posts/aws-summit-2025#dream-city" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p><img src="/pages/posts/aws-summit-2025/DREAMcity.gif" alt="Dream City" class="markdown-img" /></p><p><img src="/pages/posts/aws-summit-2025/dreamCityArch.jpg" alt="Dream City Architecture" class="markdown-img" /></p><p>One team demonstrated a failsafe and load-balancing electricity mechanism for a small city.
The city was powered by various electricity sources, such as solar panels and wind turbines.
A volunteer could simulate a failure by, for example, placing dirt on a solar panel.
When this happened, less power was supplied to city lights or the amusement park,
but essential buildings, like the hospital, still received power.</p><p>Preparing everything and ensuring it worked seamlessly undoubtedly required significant effort.</p><h3>AWS BuilderCards <a id="aws-buildercards" href="/posts/aws-summit-2025#aws-buildercards" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p><img src="/pages/posts/aws-summit-2025/builderCards.jpg" alt="BuilderCards game" class="markdown-img" /></p><p>Everyone could join others to play the BuilderCards game.
This card game was well-prepared and highly educational.
By playing, you could learn about real relationships between AWS services.
It also included some humorous elements, and I highly recommend it ðŸ˜º.</p><h3>DeepRacer <a id="deepracer" href="/posts/aws-summit-2025#deepracer" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p><img src="/pages/posts/aws-summit-2025/deepRacer.jpg" alt="DeepRacer rover" class="markdown-img" /></p><p>One exhibition presented the 4-wheeled rover which was able to recognize the track and keep the correct path
autonomously.</p><h3>Others <a id="others" href="/posts/aws-summit-2025#others" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p><img src="/pages/posts/aws-summit-2025/pinball.jpg" alt="PinBall" class="markdown-img" /></p><p>Many other exhibitions and games were available at sponsor stands,
including a Pinball game where you could win a LEGO Technic car set (I tried but had no luck).
There was even a lottery with a PlayStation as the grand prize.</p><h2>Food and beverages <a id="food-and-beverages" href="/posts/aws-summit-2025#food-and-beverages" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p><img src="/pages/posts/aws-summit-2025/food.jpg" alt="My dessert" class="markdown-img" /></p><p>I have to say that the catering service was brilliant.
Everyone could have a hot coffee, lemon juice or a piece of cake without a need to wait in a long queue.
Breakfast and lunch were also tasty and new food was delivered constantly.</p><hr /><h1>Sessions <a id="sessions" href="/posts/aws-summit-2025#sessions" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>The AWS Summit in Katowice was a whirlwind of insights, demos, and forward-thinking discussions about AI, cloud
infrastructure, and cybersecurity. Below is a detailed recap of the sessions I attended. Each session offered unique
perspectives on how AWS and its partners are shaping the future of technology.</p><h2>9:00 Streamline RAG and Model Evaluation with Amazon Bedrock <a id="900-streamline-rag-and-model-evaluation-with-amazon-bedrock" href="/posts/aws-summit-2025#900-streamline-rag-and-model-evaluation-with-amazon-bedrock" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>The day kicked off with a session on <strong>Amazon Bedrock</strong>, a powerful tool for evaluating and selecting foundation models
for AI applications. The speaker emphasized the importance of evaluation to balance <strong>quality, cost, and latency</strong>
trade-offs when choosing models.</p><h3>Key Takeaways <a id="key-takeaways" href="/posts/aws-summit-2025#key-takeaways" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Model Evaluation</strong>: Amazon Bedrock simplifies the process of comparing and selecting the best foundation model using

applications. From <strong>Amazon Bedrock</strong>â€™s streamlined RAG and model evaluation to <strong>Ryanair</strong>â€™s cloud security
innovations, the sessions showcased AWSâ€™s leadership in AI, cloud, and cybersecurity. The iterative nature of AI
development, the power of tools like <strong>SageMaker</strong> and <strong>Amazon Q</strong>, and the growing role of AI in cybersecurity left me
inspired and eager to explore these technologies further.</p><p>Additionally, the Summit provided an excellent opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals, see cool exhibitions
and enjoy participating in engaging games organized by AWS and its sponsors.</p><p>One drawback coming to my mind was that I missed one session by Cloudflare because I was a minute late and
the room was already full. However, I understand that the interest could not be predicted.</p><p>If youâ€™re considering attending a future AWS events, do it! The mix of hands-on demos, customer stories, and expert
insights is invaluable for anyone in the tech space.</p><hr /><p><em>Note: This blog post is based on my personal notes and reflects my understanding of the sessions. For official details,
