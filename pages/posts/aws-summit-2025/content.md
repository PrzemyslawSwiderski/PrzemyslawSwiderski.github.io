# My Experience at the AWS Summit in Katowice

This year, I was once again invited to an AWS event, this time held in Katowice. In this post, I'll share my experience
and highlights from the summit.

# In between sessions

## Venue

Compared to the event in Warsaw a year ago, I believe the venue and organization were significantly better.
The main exhibition hall was very spacious, with no "traffic" congestion. In contrast, at the Warsaw event,
the sponsor stands were spread across different floors, which sometimes led to crowded conditions.

The rooms where the sessions were held were also much more spacious.
This was particularly true for the Keynote Hall and Auditorium,
where everyone had a comfortable seat, and the speakers experienced
no technical issues (at least none that I noticed 😊).

## Exhibitions and Games

During the Summit, various AWS teams showcased engaging demos and exhibitions.

### Free Kick Challenge

The challenge was to score a goal with the fastest dribbling time and shot speed possible.

I tried my hand at it but would rather not share the details 😅.
Essentially, I performed much worse than the person in the GIF.
Out of three shots, one hit the post, and the others veered far from the goal 😊.

It was an exhilarating and well-organized game.
I even saw that someone on the leaderboard kicked the ball at a speed exceeding 90 km/h.

### Dream City

![Dream City Architecture](dreamCityArch.jpg)

One team demonstrated a failsafe and load-balancing electricity mechanism for a small city.
The city was powered by various electricity sources, such as solar panels and wind turbines.
A volunteer could simulate a failure by, for example, placing dirt on a solar panel.
When this happened, less power was supplied to city lights or the amusement park,
but essential buildings, like the hospital, still received power.

Preparing everything and ensuring it worked seamlessly undoubtedly required significant effort.

### AWS BuilderCards

Everyone could join others to play the BuilderCards game.
This card game was well-prepared and highly educational.
By playing, you could learn about real relationships between AWS services.
It also included some humorous elements, and I highly recommend it 😺.

### DeepRacer

One exhibition presented the 4-wheeled rover which was able to recognize the track and keep the correct path
autonomously.

### Others

![PinBall](pinball.jpg)

Many other exhibitions and games were available at sponsor stands,
including a Pinball game where you could win a LEGO Technic car set (I tried but had no luck).
There was even a lottery with a PlayStation as the grand prize.

## Food and beverages

![My dessert](food.jpg)

I have to say that the catering service was brilliant.
Everyone could have a hot coffee, lemon juice or a piece of cake without a need to wait in a long queue.
Breakfast and lunch were also tasty and new food was delivered constantly.
