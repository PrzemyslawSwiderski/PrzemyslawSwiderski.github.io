<p>GitHub has this cool feature that lets the developer search the code by some criteria.</p><p>If we for example, type <code>path:build.gradle.kts AND &quot;commonWebpackConfig&quot;</code> into the search bar,
there will be sample usages in public repositories listed:</p><p><img src="/pages/posts/github-search/sample-search-results.png" alt="Search Results" class="markdown-img" /></p><blockquote><p>Please note that only the default branches like <code>main</code> or <code>master</code> are indexed for the results.</p></blockquote><p>Syntax supports other qualifiers like <code>language</code> as well.
Docs can be
found <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/github-code-search/understanding-github-code-search-syntax"><strong>HERE</strong></a>.</p><p>It is pretty useful when we are learning new tools/frameworks and want to check how to use particular features or even
find some example projects ðŸ˜Š.</p>
