better at predicting the recession and why?
</code></pre><p>and the answer was:</p><pre><code class="language-text">The T10Y3M yield curve uninversion (when it stops being inverted and returns to a normal positive slope) 
is generally better at predicting a recession compared to the T10Y2Y uninversion. 
Here's why:

1. Proximity to Recession:

* T10Y3M uninversion often occurs closer to the onset of a recession, making it a more immediate and reliable signal.
* T10Y2Y uninversion can occur further from a recession, and its timing is less consistent.

2. Economic Mechanism:

* The T10Y3M is more directly influenced by Federal Reserve policy and short-term economic conditions. 
  Its uninversion often reflects a pivot in monetary policy (e.g., rate cuts) due to growing economic weakness ‚Äî&gt; a direct precursor to recession.
* The T10Y2Y, while useful, is less sensitive to policy shifts and short-term dynamics, 
  making its uninversion a weaker recession predictor.

Summary:
The T10Y3M uninversion is a better predictor of recessions because it signals that 
short-term rates have fallen in response to deteriorating economic conditions, 
often marking the final lead-up to a downturn.
</code></pre><p>As seen above, &quot;10-Year Treasury Minus 3-Month Treasury Yield&quot; has been chosen to be a better indicator.</p><p>I also wanted to know some details:</p><pre><code class="language-text">Once T10Y3M uninverts, what is the probability the recession and how much time is needed on average 
to see a major spike in the unemployment after the T10Y3M uninversion?
Can you please list historical examples?
Please give rather brief answer in a notepad format.
</code></pre><p>Answer:</p><pre><code class="language-text">T10Y3M Uninversion and Recession/Unemployment Spike

**Probability of Recession**: 
- ~80% or higher after T10Y3M uninversion.

**Time to Major Unemployment Spike**: 
- Typically 6‚Äì18 months after uninversion.

**Historical Examples**:

1. **1980 Recession**
   - Uninversion: Early 1980
   - Recession Start: Q1 1980 (~3 months later)
   - Unemployment: Rose from ~6% to ~7.8% by mid-1980.

2. **1990 Recession**
   - Uninversion: Late 1988
   - Recession Start: Mid-1990 (~18 months later)
   - Unemployment: Rose from ~5.4% to ~6.8% by early 1991.

3. **2001 Dot-Com Recession**
   - Uninversion: Early 2000
   - Recession Start: March 2001 (~12 months later)
   - Unemployment: Rose from ~4% to ~6% by 2003.

4. **2008 Global Financial Crisis**
   - Uninversion: Mid-2007
   - Recession Start: December 2007 (~6 months later)
   - Unemployment: Rose from ~5% to ~10% by 2009.

5. **2020 COVID-19 Recession**
   - Uninversion: Late 2019
   - Recession Start: February 2020 (~3 months later)
   - Unemployment: Rose from ~3.5% to ~14.7% by April 2020.

**Summary**:
- High probability of recession after T10Y3M uninversion.
- Unemployment spike follows within 6‚Äì18 months on average.
