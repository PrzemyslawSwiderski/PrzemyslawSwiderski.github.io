Proximity to Recession:\n\n* T10Y3M uninversion often occurs closer to the onset of a recession, making it a more immediate and reliable signal.\n* T10Y2Y uninversion can occur further from a recession, and its timing is less consistent.\n\n2. Economic Mechanism:\n\n* The T10Y3M is more directly influenced by Federal Reserve policy and short-term economic conditions. \n  Its uninversion often reflects a pivot in monetary policy (e.g., rate cuts) due to growing economic weakness ‚Äî&gt; a direct precursor to recession.\n* The T10Y2Y, while useful, is less sensitive to policy shifts and short-term dynamics, \n  making its uninversion a weaker recession predictor.\n\nSummary:\nThe T10Y3M uninversion is a better predictor of recessions because it signals that \nshort-term rates have fallen in response to deteriorating economic conditions, \noften marking the final lead-up to a downturn.\n</code></pre><p>As seen above, &quot;10-Year Treasury Minus 3-Month Treasury Yield&quot; has been chosen to be a better indicator.</p><p>I also wanted to know some details:</p><pre><code class="language-text">Once T10Y3M uninverts, what is the probability the recession and how much time is needed on average \nto see a major spike in the unemployment after the T10Y3M uninversion?\nCan you please list historical examples?\nPlease give rather brief answer in a notepad format.\n</code></pre><p>Answer:</p><pre><code class="language-text">T10Y3M Uninversion and Recession/Unemployment Spike\n\n**Probability of Recession**: \n- ~80% or higher after T10Y3M uninversion.\n\n**Time to Major Unemployment Spike**: \n- Typically 6‚Äì18 months after uninversion.\n\n**Historical Examples**:\n\n1. **1980 Recession**\n   - Uninversion: Early 1980\n   - Recession Start: Q1 1980 (~3 months later)\n   - Unemployment: Rose from ~6% to ~7.8% by mid-1980.\n\n2. **1990 Recession**\n   - Uninversion: Late 1988\n   - Recession Start: Mid-1990 (~18 months later)\n   - Unemployment: Rose from ~5.4% to ~6.8% by early 1991.\n\n3. **2001 Dot-Com Recession**\n   - Uninversion: Early 2000\n   - Recession Start: March 2001 (~12 months later)\n   - Unemployment: Rose from ~4% to ~6% by 2003.\n\n4. **2008 Global Financial Crisis**\n   - Uninversion: Mid-2007\n   - Recession Start: December 2007 (~6 months later)\n   - Unemployment: Rose from ~5% to ~10% by 2009.\n\n5. **2020 COVID-19 Recession**\n   - Uninversion: Late 2019\n   - Recession Start: February 2020 (~3 months later)\n   - Unemployment: Rose from ~3.5% to ~14.7% by April 2020.\n\n**Summary**:\n- High probability of recession after T10Y3M uninversion.\n- Unemployment spike follows within 6‚Äì18 months on average.\n</code></pre><p>I verified the unemployment with the Federal <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE"><strong>data</strong></a>, and\nit looks like ChatGPT provided the correct analysis because all numbers are matching.</p><h2>Conclusion <a id="conclusion" href="/posts/yield-curve-inversion#conclusion" class="anchor-link">üîó</a></h2><p>Based on the <code>T10Y3M</code> trend, it is likely it will return to positive in a month or two.</p><p>With the help of ChatGPT, I found that economic turmoil and a recession could become more probable.</p><p>In such a case, the unemployment rate could rise significantly, but let\'s hope that the FED will magically\nimplement &quot;soft landing&quot; and not cause the inflation to return üôè.</p><p>Otherwise, it will be ordinary people who are impacted the most, and wealth inequality could widen even further.</p><h2>19.12.2024 Update <a id="19122024-update" href="/posts/yield-curve-inversion#19122024-update" class="anchor-link">üîó</a></h2><p>On 13th of December, the <code>T10Y3M</code> uninverted to <code>0.06%</code>, indicating a heightened probability of a recession in 2025.</p>'}}]);
