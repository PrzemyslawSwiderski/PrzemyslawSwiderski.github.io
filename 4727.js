Metrics not the developer\'s feelings are crucial to verify which solution/model is better.</p><p>Trash in trash out. Sanitize the input data first before teaching the model.</p><p>Team Topologies book recommendation.</p><h2>12:00 PM - Breaking Out to a New Developer Productivity: Amazon Q and Beyond</h2><p>Two people from PrivatBank.</p><p>After war in ukraine broke, they were forced to migrate the infrastructure to AWS.\nAmazon Q Developer supports developers across the whole SDLC. It can save development time.</p><p>Q can scan not only the repositories but resources (IAM, RDS) in AWS account to support development.\nIt was very helpful with Java migration.</p><p>Drawbacks:</p><ul><li>sometimes it takes 10 seconds for the hints to appear (in Ukraine)</li><li>security scans on large project are slow</li><li>needs more precise prompts, less forgiving than ChatGPT</li></ul><p>Due to law restrictions SLA includes that the code must stay internally in the bank AWS account.</p><p>The generic code model is extended with the one from PrivatBank to provide proper autocompletion.</p><h2>1:00 PM - Generative AI panel: Moving beyond the hype and realizing value</h2><p>Very good Q&amp;A session with 5 startup founders/investors.</p><p>GenAI is rule-changing in terms of time saved for the initial development.\nSomeone can create solution in much less time than before</p><p>The Biggest investor‚Äôs question, what will the GenAI startup do in 6 years?\nWhat is the plan if every week braking changes are done in AI field.\nFocusing on a niche is very important.</p><p>One founder had an idea to replace HR with AI for unbiased decision-making...</p><p>Goldman Sachs has about 200 petabytes of financial data.\nIt is hard for the smaller startups to compete with tech giants since they have much more resources and training data.</p><p>You don‚Äôt need ChatGPT if the problem can be solved done with 4 ifs in the code instead.</p><p>Your AI is as good as your data.</p><p>Some startups are not aware of legal actions needed to be taken when learning the model with customers data.\nThey are risking costly lawsuits.</p><p>Current AI market state resembles the dot-com bubble.</p><p>All agreed that there are too high expectations (fueled by hype) about the AI now.</p><h2>3:00 PM - Platform engineering with Amazon EKS</h2><p>Presentation done by the senior solutions architect covering best practices and tips when dealing with AWS\ninfrastructure.</p><p>Don‚Äôt boil the ocean. Less is more. Keep it simple üòè.</p><p><a href="https://backstage.io/">Backstage.io</a> for the ultimate visualization solution.</p><p><a href="https://karpenter.sh/">Karpenter</a> to reduce and manage the cluster costs.</p><p>Instead of wiki as docs, use <a href="https://chatboxai.app/en">Chatbox AI</a> to save time.</p><h2>4:00 PM - Build without limits: lessons from using AI-powered developer tools</h2><p><a href="https://community.aws/@ricsueaws">Ricardo Sueiras</a> sharing his experience with Amazon Q.</p><p>AI saves time when writing repetitive and boilerplate code.</p><p>Always add version to prompt (e.g. Spring Boot) to help finding the solution.</p><p>Generated code can be not secure. Trust, but always verify.</p><p>AI will not replace developers yet (at least for the next 10 years üòÖ).</p><p>Too bad the demo did not work üòû and Amazon Q had some connectivity issues.</p><h2>5:00 PM - How security teams can strengthen security using generative AI</h2><p>Two security advisors from AWS.</p><p>When creating the solutions with GenAI we should be aware\nof <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)">Hallucinations</a>.\nWhich can result in responses that are authoritative but wrong.</p><p>They created a Chatbot which scans AWS services and finds potential loopholes.\nIt suggests solutions and good practices in response.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>I think it was a very productive day, and besides the stickers and pens üòä, I gained valuable knowledge about AWS GenAI\nservices.</p><p>There were some technical issues, but overall, the organization was good, and I hope there will be more sessions like\nthat in Poland in the future.</p><p>When working remotely, it\'s refreshing to meet and talk with IT professionals in person üòâ.</p>'}}]);
