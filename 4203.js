It took about 10 minutes to complete.\nActually, the most time-consuming part was finding a free pen drive I could use for the bootable device\nand uploading the system into it.</p><h3>Hardware support <a id="hardware-support" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#hardware-support" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>All the laptop\'s components Wi-Fi, touchpad, sound, webcam worked out of the box, which surprised me pleasantly.</p><p>Even external monitor speakers are connecting all the time. \nIt was not the case in Windows when I had to reconnect HDMI cable manually for them to work properly.</p><h3>Price <a id="price" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#price" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>One of positives is that I could simply download the latest Ubuntu entirely for free\nfrom <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop"><strong>here</strong></a>.\nThis way I saved about 100$ I would have to spend on Windows license.</p><h3>Faster Code Development <a id="faster-code-development" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#faster-code-development" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Last time I used Ubuntu was about 5 years ago when I worked at TomTom.\nAt that time, I already know it was better than Windows in terms of compilation speed.\nAfter installing IntelliJ on my new Ubuntu setup and building some sample projects,\nit is clear for me, I won\'t be coming back to Windows anytime soon ðŸ¤£.\nGradle build and test speeds are so much faster.\nBuilding this entire blog project repo took about 30 seconds.\nBefore, I had to wait more than 5 minutes to complete it on Windows.</p><p>Because of different file system (ext4) and no background processes like Windows Defender,\nIntelliJ project indexing process is also much faster.</p><h3>Configurability <a id="configurability" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#configurability" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Ubuntu outshines Windows in terms of customization and configurability.\nIt is possible to configure every pixel of the UI â€” keybindings, layout, animations, etc.\nI am able to configure nearly everything via dotfiles (<code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.gitconfig</code> or <code>.config/monitors.xml</code>).</p><p>It is also easy to launch additional apps or scripts with &quot;Startup Application Preferences&quot; system util.\nThanks to that, I created some bash script which plays an internet radio automatically on system startup\nwith the VLC player.</p><p>Full <code>radio.sh</code> script:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash\n# Define radio stations\ndeclare -A stations\nstations=(\n  [1]=&quot;https://livestreaming-node-4.srg-ssr.ch/srgssr/rsc_de/aac/96&quot;\n  [2]=&quot;https://media-ice.musicradio.com/ClassicFMMP3&quot;\n  [3]=&quot;https://centova87.shoutcastservices.com/proxy/revolution935/stream&quot;\n  [4]=&quot;https://stream.trance.ie/tpmixes&quot;\n  [5]=&quot;https://fr.ah.fm/live&quot;\n)\n# Get user choice from script argument or default to 1\nchoice=${1:-1}\n# Validate input and launch VLC\nif [[ ${stations[$choice]} ]]; then\n  echo &quot;Launching VLC with stream #$choice...&quot;\n  vlc &quot;${stations[$choice]}&quot;\nelse\n  echo &quot;Invalid choice: \'$choice\'&quot;\n  echo &quot;Choices:&quot;\n  echo &quot;  1) Radio Swiss Classic (default)&quot;\n  echo &quot;  2) Classic FM&quot;\n  echo &quot;  3) Revolution 935&quot;\n  echo &quot;  4) TrancePulse&quot;\n  echo &quot;  5) AH.fm&quot;\n  exit 1\nfi\n</code></pre><p>I also recommend adding symbolic link to script in <code>/usr/local/bin/</code> with the following command:</p><pre><code class="language-sh">sudo ln -s &lt;FULL PATH TO radio.sh&gt; /usr/local/bin/radio.sh\n</code></pre><p>This way it is possible to launch the radio directly from the terminal with a <code>radio</code> command.</p><h3>System and application updates <a id="system-and-application-updates" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#system-and-application-updates" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>On my corporate laptop I am using Windows, and sometimes system or application updates are triggered\nwithout the user knowledge. It is pretty annoying and can interrupt daily work.</p><p>Updating Ubuntu is always triggered by user. It is also much faster.\nSuggested updates are downloaded and installed in background and system restart is always optional.\nMoreover, Ubuntu can use different package managers like apt (shipped) snap or flatpak.\nThey are allowing the user to update applications in a single command, pin specific versions or even build\npackages from sources.</p><h3>Privacy <a id="privacy" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#privacy" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Ubuntu doesn\'t collect or send data by default.\nYou can fully inspect and modify all processes.</p><h2>Disadvantages <a id="disadvantages" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#disadvantages" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h3>Desktop Environment <a id="desktop-environment" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#desktop-environment" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>The Windows system (like the name would suggest ðŸ™‚) has still better GUI support and reliability\nfor the window based applications. I recognise that Ubuntu GNOME desktop environment got better\ncompared to 7 years ago, but it still has got issues. For example in IntelliJ, I am randomly experiencing\nflickering code tab names in UI. Some other application windows are also getting weird font resizes\nwhen changing the monitor display mode.</p><h3>Gaming <a id="gaming" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#gaming" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Some game developers like EA are still neglecting the Linux users. Games like Battlefield 1, DCS World or FIFA 23\nare not even able to be started on Ubuntu system because of Kernel level anti cheat or other reasons.\nThis is quite disappointing and hopefully will change in the future.</p><h2>Conclusion <a id="conclusion" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#conclusion" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h2>'}}]);
