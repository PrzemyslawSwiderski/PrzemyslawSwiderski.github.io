It took about 10 minutes to complete.<br />\nActually, the most time-consuming part was finding a free pen drive I could use for the bootable device\nand uploading the system onto it.</p><h3>Hardware support <a id="hardware-support" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#hardware-support" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>All the laptop\'s components Wi-Fi, touchpad, sound, webcam worked out of the box, which surprised me pleasantly.</p><p>Even the external monitor speakers connect automatically every time.<br />\nThat wasn\'t the case on Windows, where I had to reconnect the HDMI cable manually for them to work properly.</p><h3>Price <a id="price" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#price" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>One of positives is that I could simply download the latest Ubuntu entirely for free\nfrom <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop"><strong>here</strong></a>.\nThis way I saved about 100$ I would have had to spend on Windows license.</p><h3>Faster Code Development <a id="faster-code-development" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#faster-code-development" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>The last time I used Ubuntu was about 5 years ago when I worked at TomTom.<br />\nEven back then, I already knew it was better than Windows in terms of compilation speed.<br />\nAfter installing IntelliJ on my new Ubuntu setup and building some sample projects,<br />\nit\'s clear to me: I won\'t be coming back to Windows anytime soon ðŸ¤£.</p><p>Gradle build and test speeds are significantly faster.<br />\nBuilding this entire blog project repo took about 30 seconds.<br />\nBefore, I had to wait more than 5 minutes to complete it on Windows.</p><p>Because of the different file system (ext4) and no background processes like Windows Defender,<br />\nthe IntelliJ project indexing process is also much faster.</p><h3>Configurability <a id="configurability" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#configurability" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Ubuntu outshines Windows in terms of customization and configurability.<br />\nIt\'s possible to tweak every pixel of the UIâ€”keybindings, layout, animations, etc.<br />\nI can configure nearly everything via dotfiles (<code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.gitconfig</code>, or <code>.config/monitors.xml</code>).</p><p>It\'s also easy to launch additional apps or scripts using the <strong>Startup Applications</strong> utility.<br />\nThanks to that, I created a bash script that plays an internet radio station automatically on system startup\nvia VLC.</p><p>Here\'s the full <code>radio.sh</code> script:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash\n# Define radio stations\ndeclare -A stations\nstations=(\n  [1]=&quot;https://livestreaming-node-4.srg-ssr.ch/srgssr/rsc_de/aac/96&quot;\n  [2]=&quot;https://media-ice.musicradio.com/ClassicFMMP3&quot;\n  [3]=&quot;https://centova87.shoutcastservices.com/proxy/revolution935/stream&quot;\n  [4]=&quot;https://stream.trance.ie/tpmixes&quot;\n  [5]=&quot;https://fr.ah.fm/live&quot;\n)\n# Get user choice from script argument or default to 1\nchoice=${1:-1}\n# Validate input and launch VLC\nif [[ ${stations[$choice]} ]]; then\n  echo &quot;Launching VLC with stream #$choice...&quot;\n  vlc &quot;${stations[$choice]}&quot;\nelse\n  echo &quot;Invalid choice: \'$choice\'&quot;\n  echo &quot;Choices:&quot;\n  echo &quot;  1) Radio Swiss Classic (default)&quot;\n  echo &quot;  2) Classic FM&quot;\n  echo &quot;  3) Revolution 935&quot;\n  echo &quot;  4) TrancePulse&quot;\n  echo &quot;  5) AH.fm&quot;\n  exit 1\nfi\n</code></pre><p>I also recommend adding symbolic link to the script in <code>/usr/local/bin/</code> with the following command:</p><pre><code class="language-sh">sudo ln -s &lt;FULL PATH TO radio.sh&gt; /usr/local/bin/radio.sh\n</code></pre><p>This way, you can launch the radio directly from the terminal with a simple <code>radio</code> command.</p><h3>System and application updates <a id="system-and-application-updates" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#system-and-application-updates" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>On my corporate laptop, I use Windows, and sometimes system or application updates are triggered\nwithout the user\'s knowledge. It\'s pretty annoying and can interrupt daily work.</p><p>Updating Ubuntu is always triggered by the user. It\'s also much faster.\nSuggested updates are downloaded and installed in the background, and system restarts are always optional.</p><p>Moreover, Ubuntu supports different package managers like apt (default), snap, or flatpak.\nThey allow the user to update applications with a single command, pin specific versions,\nor even build packages from source.</p><h3>Privacy <a id="privacy" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#privacy" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Ubuntu doesn\'t collect or send data by default.\nYou can fully inspect and modify all processes.</p><h2>Disadvantages <a id="disadvantages" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#disadvantages" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h3>Desktop Environment <a id="desktop-environment" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#desktop-environment" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Windows (like the name suggests ðŸ™‚) still has better GUI support and reliability for window-based applications.\nI recognize that Ubuntu\'s GNOME desktop environment has improved compared to 7 years ago,\nbut it still has issues.</p><p>For example, in IntelliJ, I occasionally experience flickering tab names in the UI.\nSome other application windows also show weird font resizing issues when switching display modes.</p><h3>Gaming <a id="gaming" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#gaming" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>Some game developers like EA are still neglecting the Linux users. Games like Battlefield 1, DCS World or FIFA 23\ncan not even be launched on Ubuntu due to kernel-level anti-cheat or other limitations.\nThis is quite disappointing and hopefully will change in the future.</p><h3>Microsoft Office Apps Compatibility <a id="microsoft-office-apps-compatibility" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#microsoft-office-apps-compatibility" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>One of the biggest drawbacks of switching to Ubuntu is the lack of native Microsoft Office support.\nYes, I can use the <strong>web versions</strong> of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint in the browser,\nand they\'re fine for quick edits or light usage.\nBut for more advanced featuresâ€”like working with large spreadsheets,\ntrack changes in Word documents, or inserting complex chartsâ€”these web versions fall short.</p><p>I also tried using <strong>LibreOffice</strong> and <strong>OnlyOffice</strong>,\nwhich are great open-source alternatives. However,\nformatting often breaks when opening <code>.docx</code> or <code>.pptx</code> files created in Microsoft Office.\nThis can be a dealbreaker, especially when collaborating with colleagues or clients who use Office daily.</p><p>Installing the full Microsoft Office suite using <strong>Wine</strong> is technically possible,\nbut it\'s inconsistent and lacks proper support.\nOutlook, in particular, doesn\'t behave well outside of Windows.</p><p>So if your workflow depends heavily on advanced Office features, be prepared for some trade-offs.</p><h2>Conclusion <a id="conclusion" href="/posts/ubuntu-experience#conclusion" class="anchor-link">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Switching to Ubuntu on my new laptop has been a refreshing experience.\nIt boots faster, runs smoother, and gives me complete control over my development environment.\nThe ability to customize nearly every part of the system (from startup scripts to dotfiles) makes it\na developer\'s dream.</p><p>There are, of course, some drawbacks, especially in gaming and occasional desktop quirks,\nbut for my daily workflow, Ubuntu wins hands down.</p><p>If you\'re a developer or power user tired of the limitations and overhead of Windows,\nUbuntu is absolutely worth a try.</p>'}}]);
